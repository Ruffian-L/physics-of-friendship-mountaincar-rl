# The Physics of Friendship: MountainCar Q-SMA

> **An exploration of how habits, topology, memory, and physics combine to teach an agent to escape a valley.**

This is a research project exploring reinforcement learning on the MountainCar-v0 environment using **Q-SMA** (Q-Learning + Sensory-Motor Attunement) — a hybrid architecture that blends classical RL with biologically-inspired systems: habit formation (Flux), topological self-monitoring (TDA), dream replay, Gaussian "scar tissue" memory (Splats), and a Niodoo physics engine patterned on LLM force dynamics.

This is not a polished framework. It's the raw, messy record of a research journey — from 0% success to 681/2000 wins across 4 phases over February 2026.

## The Problem

MountainCar-v0 is deceptively hard for RL. The car starts in a valley and must build momentum by swinging back and forth to reach a goal on the right hilltop. The reward is -1 per timestep (pure punishment), so the agent gets no signal about *how* to improve — only that it's failing. Most Q-learning agents never solve it.

---

## The Architecture: Q-SMA

**Q-SMA** stands for Q-Learning + Sensory-Motor Attunement. The core idea: an agent needs both *logic* (Q-values: what works) and *habit* (Flux: what feels natural), and must learn to transition from one to the other.

### Action Selection
```
π(s) = argmax_a [ Q(s,a) + ease(F(s,a)) × β + C(s,a) ]
```
- **Q(s,a)** — learned value (logic, System 2)
- **F(s,a)** — Flux/habit strength, passed through a sigmoid (System 1)
- **β** — confidence scaling, decays over training: `β = max(0.1, 1.5 × 0.995^episode)`
- **C(s,a)** — curiosity bonus from TDA-injected attractors

### Yin-Yang Reward Shaping
The breakthrough insight. Instead of raw -1 per step, the agent receives a physics-based shaped reward:
```
R_shaped = R + κ × [Φ(s') − Φ(s)]
```
where `Φ(s) = sin(3x) + 100v²` — a potential function that naturally creates balanced positive (gaining energy) and negative (losing energy) signals.

### TDA Metacognitive Loop
Every 5 episodes, the agent's recent trajectory is analyzed topologically:
- **Loop detection**: density heuristics + persistent homology (Ripser) detect stuck patterns
- **Void detection**: histogram analysis finds unexplored regions near the goal
- **Intervention**: decay spikes break bad habits; attractor injection encourages exploration

### Dream Cycle
Between episodes, the agent replays experiences weighted by Splat Memory proximity — obsessing about victories during sleep to build "neural superhighways" in the Flux landscape.

## Research Phases & Results

### Phase 1: TDA Steering (Feb 13) — 0 → 76 → 681 wins

The foundational work. Key breakthroughs:
1. **Yin-Yang Reward** — potential-based shaping that creates balanced pos/neg signals
2. **Confidence Scaling** — beta decay transitions habit→logic
3. **Spike Cooldown** — prevents TDA from over-intervening

The emergent **zig-zag learning pattern** (Hot → Complacent → Cold → Rebound) was discovered here — learning isn't monotonic, it oscillates upward.

- `zigzag_pattern.png` — the four-panel convergence diagnostic
- `well_addiction_diagnosis.png` — the "addiction to the valley bottom" trap

### Phase 2: Niodoo Dream (Feb 15) — 617 wins

Introduced the Niodoo physics engine and dream replay. Forces from an LLM-inspired vocabulary (Gravity Well, Repulsion, Viscosity, Adrenaline, Ghost Vector) are mapped to Mountain Car physics.

### Phase 3: Energy Pump (Feb 16) — 2000/2000 wins (100%)

The "push it in the direction it's going" heuristic. A trivially perfect solver (~119 steps/episode) that bypasses learning entirely. This is the well-known resonance strategy — it works, but it doesn't learn.

### Phase 4: The Bridge Experiments (Feb 17) — The Most Revealing Phase

**The question:** Can a perfect "body" (energy pump) teach a learning "mind" (Q-SMA)?

**Run 1 (Bridge 2000/2000):** Looks perfect — but the Governor override curve goes *up*, not down. The body does all the work. The mind never learns.

**Run 2 (Bridge 1522/2000):** The real test. Governor overrides drop to 0 at episode 1500. The mind immediately collapses to **4.4% win rate** — *worse* than the Q-SMA baseline of 34.1%.

> **The most important finding:** Having a perfect teacher override your decisions doesn't teach you anything. The teacher actively *prevented* learning by shielding the agent from consequences.

**Splat Memory Pivot:** 12 iterations evolving from splat reflexes in action selection (0/2000 — reflex spam at 3000-5000/ep overwhelmed the agent) to splats influencing only dream replay (628/2000 — soft curriculum through sleep).

## Hypotheses

| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|:-----------|:-------|:---------|
| Yin-Yang Reward (potential-based shaping) | ✅ Confirmed | 0 → 76 wins on this single change |
| System 1→2 Handoff (beta decay) | ✅ Confirmed | Breakthroughs cluster when beta hits floor |
| TDA Metacognitive Loop | ⚠️ Partial | Loop detection works; unclear if Ripser adds value over density heuristic |
| Viscosity/Flow Physics Model | ❌ Failed → adapted | "Correct" physics = 0 wins; naive binary = 76; log-scale = 681 |
| Splat Memory Reflexes | ⚠️ Uncertain | Disabled in act(); only influence dreams. Untested in final form |
| Niodoo Force Vocabulary | ⚠️ Partial | Works as standalone solver; unclear contribution in mixed system |
| Bridge (Body→Mind) | ❌ Failed as designed | Perfect teacher prevents learning; 4.4% when independent |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Signal strength > physical accuracy** — a binary "this is good/bad" outperforms smooth physics gradients
2. **The zig-zag IS the learning** — oscillation between exploration and exploitation converges from above
3. **Teachers who override prevent learning** — the agent must face consequences to learn from them
4. **Influence dreams, not decisions** — soft curriculum through sleep replay works; direct reflex overrides don't

## About

This is the beginning of a hypothesis, not a finished paper. It's the raw record of exploring how RL agents might learn more like biological systems — through habit, memory, dreams, and self-correction — rather than pure reward maximization.

The code is messy because research is messy. The plots are real. The dead ends are documented alongside the breakthroughs.
